Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power; database storage, applications, and other IT services. 

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
- Simple way to access servers, while you provision and use what you need via a web application

The deployment models of the cloud - 
Private cloud: cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- You have complete control.
- Provides security for sensitive applications.
- Meets specific business needs.
Example: Rackspace

Public Cloud: cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.
- Six advantages of cloud computing:
- Trade fixed expense for variable expense: you only pay for what you consume
- Benefit from massive economies of scale: because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
- Stop guessing capacity: you can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes' notice.
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes
Examples: Azure, AWS, Google Cloud

Hybrid Cloud: keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.

5 Characteristics of cloud computing:
- On demand self service: users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider.
- Broad Network Access: resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms.
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling: multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy. Multiple customers are services from the same physical resources.
- Rapid elasticity and scalability: automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed. Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
- Measured Service: Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used. 

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:

Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
- Pay on-demand: don't own hardware.
- Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Pries are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
Stop guessing capacity
- Scale based on actual measured usage
Increase speed and agility
Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Problems solved by the cloud:
- flexibility: change resource types when needed
- cost-effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- scalability: accommodate longer loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- high-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers. 
- agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

The Different Types of Cloud Computing:
IaaS: provides building blocks for cloud IT, provides networking, computers, data storage space, highest level of flexibility, easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT

PaaS: removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure, focus on the deployment and management of your applications

SaaS: completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

Example of Cloud Computing Types
IaaS: Amazon EC2, Rackspace
PaaS: Elastic Beanstalk (AWS), Google App Engine (GCP)
SaaS: Many AWS services, Salesforce
