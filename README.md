What is a cloud service Provider? A company which:
- provides multiple Cloud Services e.g. tens of hindreds of services
- those Cloud Services can be chained together to create cloud architectures
- those Cloud Services are accessible via Single Unified API e.g. AWS API
- those Cloud Services utilized metered billing based on usage e.g. per second, per hour
- those Cloud Services have rich monitoring built in e.g. AWS CloudTrail
- those Cloud Services have an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering
- those cloud services offers automation via Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

If a company offers multiple cloud services under a single UI but do not meet most of or all of these requirements (from above), it would be referred to as a Cloud Platform e.g. Twilio, HashiCorp, Databricks

Landscape of CSPs

Tier-1 (Top Tier)- Early to Market, wide offerings, strong synergies between services, well recognized in industry:
AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Alibaba Cloud (Asia)

Tier-2 (Mid-Tier)- Backed by well-known tech companies, slow to innovate and turned to specialization:
IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud

Tier-3 (Light Tier)- Virtual Private Servers (VPS) turned to offer core IaaS offering. Simple, cost-effective:
Vultr, Digital Ocean, Akamai Connected Cloud (formerly Linode)

Tier-4 (Private Tier)- IaaS software deployed to run in an organization's own private data center.
OpenStack (formerly Rackspace), Apache CloudStack, VMware vSphere

Common Cloud Services

A cloud service provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services (4 core) for IaaS would be:

- Compute: having a virtual computer that can run applications, programs, and code.
- Storage: having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.
- Networking: having virtual network defining internet connections or network isolations between services or outbound to the internet.
- Databases: a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application.

AWS has over 200+ cloud services

AWS Technology Overview: IaaS having 4 core cloud service offerings:
- Computer: EC2 Virtual Machines
- Storage: EBS Virtual Hard Drives
- Database: RDS SQL Databases
- Networking and Content Delivery: VPC Private Cloud Network

Cloud Computing Depoyment Models

Public Cloud: everything is built on the CSP (also known as Cloud-Native/First)
Private Cloud: everything built on a company's datacenter, "On=Premise"
Hybrid: using both on-premise and cloud service provider
Cross-Cloud: using multiple cloud providers at the same time

Deployment Model Use Cases

Cloud (Fully Utilizing Cloud Computing): startups, SaaS Offerings, new projects and companies
Hybrid Using both Cloud and On-Premise): Banks, FinTech, Investment Management, Large Service Providers, Legacy On-Premise
On-Premise (Local Resources, "private cloud"): Organizations that cannot run on cloud due to strict regulatory compliance or the sheer size of organization. Public Sector, Hospitals, Insurance Companies
